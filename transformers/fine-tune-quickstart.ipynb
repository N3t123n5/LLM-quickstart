The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

This restaurant is located in an oh-so-charming part of town with even lovelier people.  The restaurant has a cheesy cowboy theme with sawdust on the floor and gun toting waitresses.  The food is pretty cheap.  We got the 21.99 meal for two which came with an onion ring and fried zucchini app, two entrees, and a pie for dessert.  The onion rings were delicious, and super crunchy, just the way I like them.  I don't like zucchini, so I didn't have any.  For my entree, I got the bacon wrapped filet, and it was funny.  It was certainly not a filet and I think the \\\"bacon\\\" was actually just a thin strip of steak wrapped around steak.  The steak was cooked exactly the way I wanted it, but unfortunately, it was a poor cut of meat that resulted in a pretty tough steak.  The corn on the cob I had was good and the mashed potatoes and gravy were decent.  The pie we took home and ate later, and it was pretty good.  Don't come here expecting 5 star food, because that is only setting yourself up for failure.  It's cheap food at cheap prices and it's not that bad.  I enjoyed my experience, and I could possibly go back at some point in the distant future.</td>\n",

And while some of the entree's looked interesting, and I suppose \\\"gourmetish\\\", I was basically unimpressed.\\n\\nThe table-side prepared guacamole was very good, though $10 seems a bit pricey. It was nice and chunky, just how I like it (though the onions were TOO chunky for my taste. Unlike a previous reviewer noted, the jalapenos were diced to the perfect size).\\n\\nChips were excellent, and the salsas were quite tasty, but had absolutely no fire.\\n\\nI ordered the Enchiladas de Mole, which were just OK. Not bad, not great. The \\\"Sweet, spicy blend of dried Mexican peppers\\\" made me think there would be some spice/fire to this dish, but again there was none. Flavorful, yes. Spicy, not-so-much. And there was something odd about the taste that we couldn't quite place. One of those dishes that I couldn't quite decide if I liked or not. It was almost as if the cook did something for the sole purpose of making it \\\"gourmet\\\".\\n\\nMy lovely bride ordered a combo plate that was anything but \\\"gourmet\\\". It was standard Mexican fare. Again, OK but not great by any stretch of the imagination (and available for half the price at any mom &amp; pop type place on the planet).\\n\\nThe guy behind me ordered fajitas that smelled delightful. Then again, you can throw a hunk of any form of beef on a sizzling skillet and it'll smell delightful to me. \\n\\nService was very good. We were seated swiftly (the place was basically empty at noon, which doesn't bode well for their future) and the food came quickly. Our soda / tea / chips were never empty. Very attentive service, though not particularly friendly. Clearly not rude, just sort of \\\"there\\\".\\n\\nThis place looks like it might be fun to hang out and have drinks. A large (and apparently well stocked) bar is front and center. With margaritas pushing $12 a pop though, be sure to check your credit limit before leaving home.\\n\\nIn short, you can slap \\\"gourmet\\\" on the facade and on the menu. You can charge \\\"gourmet\\\" prices. But if you don't serve gourmet food, you wind up with a two star restaurant that I can't recommend....</td>\n",

Whether this will suit you or not will remain up to personal taste.\\n\\nFor what my opinions worth there are better shops with better 'hang on your wall' paintings for similar prices so unless you're into the unusual and more quirky then it's less likely to be the place for you.

The fact that the area, by his admission was cleaned over 45 mins prior to my saying anything was not addressed.  He also claimed that they are cleaning and sanitizing the custard machine constantly so they can serve fresh custard.  Again, I don't think so.  I've worked behind the counter at enough fast food restaraunts to know that icecream machines are not constantly cleaned, otherwise, they would never serve anything out of them.  I've also seen crews breakdown machines early so they didn't have to stay any longer than possible after closing time. \\n\\nHe also viewed the video and saw people moving the chairs to leave, so using them was just an act of lazyness on the part of his crew. \\n\\nSo what does this mean for me?????

My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Lamb Vindaloo, Paneer Makhani, and their garlic naan (the best naan I've ever tasted). If you enjoy super spicy, make sure you request the chef's spicy! You may be disappointed if you don't request extra spicy.\\n\\n Every Friday and Saturday the exotic spicy cuisine is paired with its spicy, exotic belly dancers. I highly recommend checking this hidden gem out.</td>\n",

I wasn't aware that they closed between lunch and dinner so when we showed up right before 5 it was a little awkward. I almost thought it had closed down because it looked that way from the outside. They have a decent sized patio in the front that is not utilized. The place would look so much more welcoming if something was done with the front of the building. So we get in and are seated. Not long after three more parties show up and are seated while we were dining. The service was fast and friendly as our waiter quickly came over to take drink and food orders. I asked some questions about what was vegan on the menu and the waiter pointed out a few items and we picked out two, and my mom got a lamb dish. \\n\\nThe two dishes we ordered were the Masala Aloo Gobi, which is a potato and cauliflower curry,  and Chana Masala, which was a chickpea with curry spices. My mom and husband also ordered some bread for the table, which I didn't eat because it contained dairy. The food was ok. I was surprised by both how simple they were and the portion sizes considering our entrees were ten dollars each. I felt like I could have made this at home for no more than a few dollars of ingredients. I was also expecting some heat in the dishes, but there was none. There was a nice curry flavor but I didn't feel like the dishes lived up to the name of the restaurant. My mom liked her lamb dish but also said that she has had better elsewhere. The final bill for three entrees, the bread, and my husband ordered a mango drink was a couple dollars short of $50, which seemed crazy to me considering how little food is actually given.\\n\\nAfter some thought, I most likely wont be returning here. It's not that the food was terrible or the service was bad, everyone was actually really friendly, I just don't feel like we got a good deal, and I feel that I could make curry just as well or better than here on my own and for a lot less money.</td>\n",
